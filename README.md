# CARP

CARP is a "CAS Authentication Reverse Proxy" framework.

## Usage

Configure your environment:

```yaml
base-url: https://192.168.56.2
cas-url: https://192.168.56.2/cas
service-url: http://192.168.56.1:9090
target-url: http://localhost:8070
skip-ssl-verification: true
port: 9090
principal-header: X-CARP-Authentication
```

If you want to redirect logout request, this can be configured with the keys `logout-method`,
specifying a http method (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, ...) and/or `logout-path` specifying the
suffix of the logout path. Example:

```yaml
logout-method: DELETE
logout-path: /rapture/session
```

If you want resources to be available anonymously (=without authentication) in your application,
you can configure the way your resource paths look like with the `resource-path` option:

```yaml
resource-path: /nexus/repository
```

### Bypassing CAS-Authentication
Sometimes it is useful to bypass the cas-authentication, for instance requests with service-account-users, which only exist in the dogu, but not in CAS/LDAP.
This prevents request-throttling in CAS for requests that only have dogu-internal authentication.
Since CAS also has throttling for unsuccessful requests, a limiter can be used in the CARP as well. 

The following config can be used for this:

```yaml
# a regex that matches the username of the basic-auth user from the request that should bypass cas-authentication
service-account-name-regex: "^service_account_([A-Za-z0-9]+)_([A-Za-z0-9]+)$"
# limiter limits unsuccessful requests using the token-bucket-algorithm (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket)
# is the rate how many tokens will be refreshed, here: 10/s
limiter-token-rate: 10
# is the initial and maximum size of the bucket containing the tokens
limiter-burst-size: 150
# the interval in which staled or expired clients will be removed from the throttling list
limiter-clean-interval: 300
```


## Start the server:

```go
package main

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  configuration, err := InitializeAndReadConfiguration()
  if err != nil {
     panic(err)
  }

  log.Infof("start carp %s", Version)

  server, err := NewServer(configuration)
  if err != nil {
	panic(err)
  }

  server.ListenAndServe()
}
```

## Structure

The CARP is structured by four HTTP-Handlers which are wrapped around each other.
They are called in the following order:

### 1. Dogu-Rest-Handler
The Dogu-Rest-Handler is the first / outermost handler to call.
It checks if the incoming request is a non-browser-request and if this request has basic-authentication with a username which matches a configured regular-expression.
When the expression matches the request is marked as "Service-Account-Authentication", which then can used by other handlers to e.g. bypass cas-authentication.
The Dogu-Rest-Handler wraps the Throttling-Handler and calls it afterwards.

### 2. Throttling-Handler
The Throttling-Handler checks if the incoming request is marked as "Service-Account-Authentication" and if so throttling is performed if needed.
The throttling is performed based on the remote IP address and the username by using the [token-bucket-algorithm](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/time/rate#Limiter) for unsuccessful 
requests (HTTP status code 4xx). When too many unsuccessful requests are performed, the throttling handler will stop forwarding request by returning a http error (http status code 429).
The Throttling-Handler wraps the CAS-Handler and calls it afterwards.

### 3. CAS-Handler
The CAS-Handler checks if the incoming request is marked as "Service-Account-Authentication" and if bypasses the CAS-authentication by immediately calling the next handler.
If the request ist __not__ marked as "Service-Account-Authentication" the CAS-authentication is performed and the resulting authentication-data is added to the request-context 
The CAS-Handler wraps the Proxy-Handler and calls it afterwards.

#### 4. Proxy-Handler
The Proxy-Handler checks the authentication-data from the incoming-request.
Authenticated requests are forwarded and if needed the `UserReplicator` is called.
Unauthenticated browser-requests are redirected to CAS-Login-Page.
Unauthenticated REST-Requests are also forwarded to configured target. 

## What is the Cloudogu EcoSystem?
The Cloudogu EcoSystem is an open platform, which lets you choose how and where your team creates great software. Each service or tool is delivered as a Dogu, a Docker container. Each Dogu can easily be integrated in your environment just by pulling it from our registry.

We have a growing number of ready-to-use Dogus, e.g. SCM-Manager, Jenkins, Nexus Repository, SonarQube, Redmine and many more. Every Dogu can be tailored to your specific needs. Take advantage of a central authentication service, a dynamic navigation, that lets you easily switch between the web UIs and a smart configuration magic, which automatically detects and responds to dependencies between Dogus.

The Cloudogu EcoSystem is open source and it runs either on-premises or in the cloud. The Cloudogu EcoSystem is developed by Cloudogu GmbH under [AGPL-3.0-only](https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-only.html).
